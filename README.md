# data-collection-challenge

In this assignment we explore data scraping using data Beautiful Soup and reinforcing previous Python skills we developed. 

In the first part of the assignment, we scraped HTML of artcle blurbs to collect their titles and summaries. We print out the list we collected to confirm the code exectued properly. 

In the second portion of the assignment we use Beautiful Soup to scrap a table about temperature and pressure on Mars. We could have used Pandas functions to read in the table from the HTML, but in an effort to enhance our HTML scraping skills, we use Beautiful Soup.

After we recreate the table from the HTML in a Pandas DataFrame, we use it answer multiple questions. We learn there are 12 months on Mars. Those 
months are compromised of 1867 days. 

Furthermore, we learned the avgerage min tempearature per month on Mars and Curiosity's location.
